### 🩵 About This Journey
This repository is more than a study tracker — it’s my personal roadmap, reflection journal, and growing portfolio.  
It documents six years of learning, application, and discovery across data, analytics, and business intelligence.

Each nightly study session (22:00–00:00 SAST) is structured, intentional, and logged.  
Every submission — whether a Python notebook, Tableau dashboard, or AWS pipeline — is a small milestone toward mastery.

> _“Discipline builds momentum. Reflection fuels growth.”_
